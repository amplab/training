Let's log into your cluster.

<p class="alert alert-warn" style="overflow:hidden" markdown="1">
<i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
Note, if you are <em>not attending the training in person</em> you need to launch your own cluster, so if you haven't done that yet [go do it now](launching-a-bdas-cluster-on-ec2.html).
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warn">
<i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
We sent the email to the address you used to registered with. If you don't see the email, first check your spam filter, then ask a TA, and finally you can try emailing {{ site.organizers-email }}, though during the training event we may not be able to keep up on email, so talking to us in person is definitely best.
</p>

First, click the tab below that corresponds to the operating system you are running to find instructions for SSH-ing into your cluster on EC2.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" data-tabs="tabs">
  <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#login_linux">Linux, Cygwin, or OS X</a></li>
  <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#login_windows">Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
<div class="tab-pane active" id="login_linux" markdown="1">
Log into your cluster via

    ssh -i <key_file> root@<master_node_hostname>

where `key_file` here is the private AWS EC2 keyfile.

__Question: I got the following permission error when I ran the above command. Help!__

<pre class="nocode">

__Answer:__ Run this command, then try to log in again:

    chmod 600 ../ampcamp.pem

You can use [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) to log into the cluster from Windows.

1. Download PuTTY from [here](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe).

2. Start PuTTY and enter the hostname that was mailed to you, as shown in the screenshot below.
